  {
    question: "What is Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)?",
    answer: "Chronic Kidney Disease is a condition characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function over time. It affects how well your kidneys filter waste and excess fluid from your blood."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the early signs of CKD?",
    answer: "Early signs include fatigue, high blood pressure, changes in urination, swelling in ankles and feet, and poor appetite. However, many people may not notice symptoms until the disease is advanced."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is at risk for CKD?",
    answer: "Risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, age over 60, and family history of kidney disease."
  },
  {
    question: "Can CKD be prevented?",
    answer: "While some causes cannot be prevented, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, controlling blood pressure and diabetes, and regular check-ups can help reduce risk."
  }
];

const detectionProcess: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "How does KidneyAI detect CKD?",
    answer: "KidneyAI uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze medical reports and tissue images, identifying patterns and markers associated with kidney disease."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of files can I upload for analysis?",
    answer: "Our system accepts medical reports in PDF, CSV, or XLSX formats, as well as high-resolution tissue images in common formats like JPG and PNG."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the detection system?",
    answer: "Our AI system has achieved a 97% accuracy rate in clinical trials, though results should always be confirmed by healthcare professionals."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the analysis take?",
    answer: "Most analyses are completed within 2-3 minutes, depending on the type and size of the uploaded files."
  }
];

const mlPredictions: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "How does machine learning improve CKD detection?",
    answer: "Machine learning can identify subtle patterns and correlations in medical data that might be missed in traditional analysis, potentially enabling earlier detection."
  },
  {
    question: "What data is used to train the AI?",
    answer: "Our AI is trained on a large, diverse dataset of anonymized medical records and tissue images from multiple healthcare institutions, ensuring robust and reliable predictions."
  },
  {
    question: "How reliable are the AI predictions?",
    answer: "While our AI system is highly accurate, it's designed to be a supportive tool for healthcare professionals, not a replacement for medical expertise."
  },
  {
    question: "How often is the AI model updated?",
    answer: "Our AI models are continuously trained on new data and updated monthly to ensure optimal performance and accuracy."
